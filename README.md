NEMESIS commerce is the first prototype of an end-to-end ecommerce stack    
written in Javascript and utilizing Ember.js for the front-end MVC along  
with Express.js to handle server side operations and routing.  MongoDB  
is used at the database, but will be database agnostic at some point.  
SASS is used for CSS/Styling.
